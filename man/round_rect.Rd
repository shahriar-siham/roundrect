\title{Draw Rounded Rectangles with Independent Corner Radii}
\usage{
round_rect(
  position = c(0.5, 0.5),
  scale = c(1, 1),
  corners = c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15),
  opacity = 1,
  fill = NA,
  border = "black",
  border_width = 1,
  border_type = "solid",
  border_cap = "round",
  gradient_type = "linear",
  gradient_stops = NULL,
  output_as_grob = FALSE,
  name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{position}{A vector of two numbers specifying the center position (x, y) of the rectangle.}

\item{scale}{A vector of two numbers specifying the width and height of the rectangle.}

\item{corners}{A vector of four numbers setting the corner roundness, starting from the top-left and moving clockwise.}

\item{opacity}{A number between 0 and 1 controlling the transparency of the rectangle (1 is fully visible, 0 is completely invisible).}

\item{fill}{A color name or hex code for the rectangle's fill color.}

\item{border}{A color name or hex code for the rectangle's border.}

\item{border_width}{A number defining the thickness of the border.}

\item{border_type}{The style of the border, such as "solid" or "dashed".}

\item{border_cap}{The shape of the border ends, such as "round" or "butt".}

\item{output_as_grob}{If TRUE, returns the rectangle as a grob (graphical object) instead of drawing it.}

\item{name}{A name for the graphical object (optional).}
}
\value{
If \code{output_as_grob} is TRUE, returns a grob object representing the rectangle. Otherwise, it draws the rectangle and returns nothing.
}
\description{
An improved version of grid's rounded rectangles, allowing each corner to have a different radius instead of a uniform one. Provides intuitive parameter names for easier usage. Customize fill color, border properties, opacity, and more with a simple function call.
